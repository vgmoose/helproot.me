		<h3>What is root?</h3>
		<p>
			You may have seen people on the Internet refer to "rooting" their Android devices. On the surface, rooting is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking">iOS Jailbreaking</a>. By rooting your device, you are enabling system-level access to your phone. There are a number of reasons why you would and wouldn't want to do this. Ultimately, though, the decision of whether or not to root your phone is up to you. Most phone and tablet manufacturers don't offer support for rooted phones. You proceed at your own risk.

		<h3>How to root the Samsung Galaxy S5</h3>
		<p>
			The Galaxy S5 is a popular phone with a lot of developer support. <a href="http://gs5.wonderhowto.com/how-to/root-any-samsung-galaxy-s5-variant-even-at-t-verizon-20-seconds-flat-0155617/">Here</a> is a guide on how to root the phone using the Towelroot method. You essentially just need to download the <a href="https://towelroot.com/">TowelRoot apk</a> and run it. You can download it by clicking on the icon in the middle of the screen at that website. If your phone will not allow you to run the apk, you need to enable uknown sources in settings under applications. After doing this, you can install the apk and run it, and finally root your phone via towel root.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your S5 does not support towelroot because it's been updated to KitKat, you can go to <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/how-root-samsung-galaxy-s5-all-models-android-442-kitkat-using-cf-auto-root-tutorial-1577576">this website</a>. There are a bunch of exploits for every carrier of the S5 that you can download and install using <a href="http://odindownload.com/">Odin for Windows</a>, or <a href="http://glassechidna.com.au/heimdall/">Heimdall for Mac/Linux</a>. Once you install the software, the phone will be rooted.

		<h3>Useful tips</h3>
		<p>
			If you hold the sleep button plus the volume down button, you will enter the bootloader mode. If you hold the sleep button plus the volume up button, you will enter recovery. Use these tips if your phone becomes unresponsive and won't boot at any point during the steps.
