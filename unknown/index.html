		<h3>What is root?</h3>
		<p>
			You may have seen people on the Internet refer to "rooting" their Android devices. On the surface, rooting is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking">iOS Jailbreaking</a>. By rooting your device, you are enabling system-level access to your phone. There are a number of reasons why you would and wouldn't want to do this. Ultimately, though, the decision of whether or not to root your phone is up to you. Most phone and tablet manufacturers don't offer support for rooted phones. You proceed at your own risk.

		<h3>How to root your <span class="mydevice">device</span></h3>
		<p>
			Rooting your phone can vary greatly depending on which device you're using. Some make it very simple to do, others make it near impossible. The model of your phone is: <span class="mydevice">likely located on either the back of your phone or under the battery</span>. This page is going to discuss general tips for rooting, but to get the best results you should try to find a guide that specifically works for the model of device that you have. For example, go to <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a> and search for "guide to root android <span class="mydevice">your model</span>". 
		</p>
		<p>
			A lot of Android phones these days can be easily rooted using <a href="http://www.kingoapp.com/">Kingo Root</a>. The process will require either a Windows computer or installing an app on your phone. Mac and Linux users can expect to use command line tools to root their phone, such as <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2431956">fastboot and ADB</a>. The hardest part of a root isn't usually the rooting itself, but rather the unlocking of the bootloader. A lot of carriers these days (such as Verizon and AT&amp;T) will encrypt the bootloaders, which means in order to put custom software on them, they require an exploit.

			As for your <span class="mydevice">device</span>, I wish you luck! :) Rooting isn't for everyone, but enabling your device to its fullest potential is always nice, and most people can find something in it, even if it can be a hassle to get into.
